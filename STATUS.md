# rotpunkt Signature Status

Last reconciled: 2026-08-14
Working branch: `redesign/devstart`

## Current Goal

Deliver a German-first, branded kitchen configurator that lets a private customer move from a shareable guest configuration to a durable Project, while preserving the approved boundaries for identity, releases, future AI photos, Quote Requests, Sanity, and commerce.

## Done

- Built the first Tailwind/Next.js design system pass from the Figma directions.
- Added reusable design-system components:
  - `BrandLogo`
  - `SiteHeader`
  - `SignatureButton`
  - `CartIndicator`
  - `CollectionStep`
  - `ImagePanel`
  - `SectionHeading`
  - `FeatureList`
- Built homepage sections:
  - `SignatureHero`
  - `CollectionCompare`
  - `MaterialRhythm`
  - `ProductStory`
- Moved navigation outside the hero and converted it to a fixed floating navbar with motion-based hide/show behavior.
- Improved hero typography animation with staggered motion.
- Added `/configure` as the first 3D configurator route.
- Built an isolated configurator feature module under `features/configurator`.
- Added a straight-line kitchen scene using React Three Fiber, drei, and Three.js.
- Loaded `public/models/kitchen-line.glb` into the configurator as the active kitchen model.
- Added heuristic GLB material mapping so cabinet/korpus and front colors affect the imported model.
- Segmented the kitchen asset into named module prefabs (`kitchen-modules.glb` + manifest) via a headless Blender pipeline: 8 wall modules, 8 island units, 2 island ends, 6 continuous elements, roles baked into mesh names. The runtime now composes the scene from prefab placements with verified exact geometric parity (per-mesh world bounds within 1e-6) against the previous monolithic model — the foundation for module-level configurability.
- Introduced Product Definition v2 (`rdtdot-signature-kitchen-v1@2`) with a Wall Module catalog, Island Sizes, sum-of-parts pricing calibrated to the historical v1 base price, and per-module finish weights. Configuration state v2 (`wallModules`, `islandSize`) flows through a discriminated-union contract, version-aware hashing (v1 hashes stay byte-compatible; v2 hashes are key-order independent), the URL codec (legacy v1 guest URLs upgrade with finishes preserved), and versioned revision display snapshots. Per the agreed posture, v1 stays parseable but unsupported: v1 revision restore returns 409, v1 shared links resolve to 410.
- Fixed two pre-existing versioning bugs: the shared-revision resolver now checks the supported-version allowlist instead of current-version equality, and shared views no longer silently fall back to the live recomputed price when a pinned display snapshot is unavailable ("Preis nicht verfügbar" instead).
- Added the itemized price presentation: an expandable "Aufstellung" in the configurator panel and full line-item breakdown in the fake checkout, both driven by the v2 sum-of-parts quote (module counts, island units, per-meter worktop, finish deltas, tax).
- Added color configuration for:
  - cabinet/korpus finish
  - front finish
- Added camera views:
  - room/signature
  - front
  - detail
- Added shareable URL state using a compact `?c=` query parameter.
- Added application-owned Customer Accounts with Better Auth email-code sign-in and server-side session resolution.
- Added the PostgreSQL Project Module, migrations, and a Project/Working Configuration persistence contract behind server-only seams.
- Connected guest “Als Projekt speichern” handoff to idempotent Project creation after sign-in.
- Saved Projects now open at `/configure?project=<uuid>` only for their owner; an expired session returns to that Project after re-authentication.
- Active saved Projects autosave the Working Configuration with expected-version optimistic concurrency. A 409 conflict leaves the remote Project unchanged and offers load-latest or save-as-new.
- Added browser-local, Project-scoped recovery drafts for unconfirmed changes, including stale-draft save-as-new handling.
- Confirmed autosaves advance the Working Configuration version and update the Project timestamp used in the account workspace.
- Added explicit “Version speichern” checkpoints for active Projects. They create or reuse an immutable Configuration Revision from the confirmed Working Configuration and remain separate from autosave.
- Added an owner-scoped, cursor-paginated Project version history with historical finish and price display snapshots resolved from the Configuration Revision's pinned Product Definition version.
- Added optimistic-concurrency-controlled version restoration. A restore first preserves the displaced Working Configuration as an immutable “Vor Wiederherstellung” safety version, then restores the selected Configuration Revision and its Product Definition identity.
- Added owner-scoped Shared Revision Links for active saved Projects. Owners can create, list, and permanently revoke 90-day links fixed to an immutable Configuration Revision.
- Shared-link secrets are generated in the browser and placed in the URL fragment. The database stores only the SHA-256 hash, and the complete link is shown only at creation time.
- Added the public `/share/[linkId]` selected-state presentation. Its POST-only resolver is private/no-store, noindex/nofollow/noarchive, and no-referrer; it exposes no Project or Customer Account data, AI-photo action, configuration mutation, or Quote Request handoff.
- Existing links remain available while a Project is archived and become unavailable when it is trashed. Public resolution currently fails closed unless the revision uses the active supported Product Definition version.
- Added `/checkout` as a fake checkout/request handoff that reads the shared configuration.
- Added a temporary product-definition contract in `features/configurator/product-definition.ts`.
- Added a Sanity adapter boundary in `features/configurator/adapters/sanity.ts`.
- Updated homepage/nav CTAs to point to `/configure`.
- Added R3F-related dependencies:
  - `@react-three/fiber`
  - `@react-three/drei`
  - `three`
  - `@types/three`
  - `lz-string`
  - `lucide-react`

## Verified Previously

- The earlier configurator slice passed lint and build, rendered a nonblank 3D canvas on desktop and mobile, and showed that color and camera changes affect the imported GLB scene.
- The shareable URL flow and fake checkout handoff preserved the configuration; mobile checkout overflow was fixed.

## Current Slice Verified

- The Shared Revision Link migration was applied to the Neon QA database.
- `pnpm test` passes 14/14 unit tests, `pnpm test:db` passes 8/8 database integration tests, and `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`, and `git diff --check` pass. The production build uses the required `TRANSACTIONAL_EMAIL_PROVIDER` environment override.
- Database coverage confirms immutable checkpointing, idempotent concurrent creation, owner scoping, secret mismatch rejection, revocation, expiry, and independence from later Working Configuration changes.
- At 1440px desktop and 390px mobile widths, the public shared-revision surface retained one nonblank canvas, had no horizontal overflow, and produced no browser-console errors.
- The Impeccable finish reviewer returned `PASS` for the public share surface.
- The current Three.js deprecation and PostgreSQL SSL forward-compatibility warnings remain known non-blockers.

## Known Warnings

- The dev browser logs warnings from the current Three/R3F stack:
  - `THREE.Clock` is deprecated in favor of `THREE.Timer`.
  - `PCFSoftShadowMap` is deprecated and falls back to `PCFShadowMap`.
- These warnings do not currently block rendering or production build, but they should be revisited before production hardening.
- `npm install` reported two moderate vulnerabilities. No audit fix was applied yet.

## Missing

- No real Sanity Studio is wired yet.
- No Sanity project ID, dataset, API version, token handling, preview mode, or live content setup exists yet.
- No page builder schema exists in this repo yet.
- No document-level localization routing is implemented yet.
- Locale routes are not implemented yet:
  - default German at `/`
  - English at `/en`
  - Spanish at `/es`
- The homepage still uses local static content from `lib/content.ts`.
- The configurator product data is local TypeScript, not fetched from Sanity.
- The Sanity adapter is a contract boundary only; it is not connected to a real query.
- No Studio page-builder block exists yet for dropping the configurator into a page.
- No real product catalog, SKU model, pricing engine, cart, checkout, order, CRM, or payment integration exists yet.
- The checkout page is a visual fake checkout only and performs no submission.
- The configurator loads `kitchen-modules.glb`: the kitchen segmented into 18 named module prefabs (wall cabinets, island units, ends) plus 6 continuous elements, with semantic roles baked into mesh names. Layout composition is still fixed to the as-authored default; module add/remove/rearrange arrives with the module configurability slices.
- The 6 continuous elements (countertop, plinths, back panels) are placed as-is and must become procedurally generated once layouts can change width.
- No analytics/event tracking exists for configurator interactions.
- The current Project workflow has unit/integration coverage, but no automated end-to-end browser coverage yet.
- Project Archive/Trash/lifecycle restoration is not implemented yet. The sharing persistence boundary already treats archived links as available and trashed links as unavailable.
- No accessibility audit has been formalized.
- No performance budgets exist for 3D, images, or page-builder pages.

## Architecture Direction

- Keep the site single-channel for now.
- Treat German as the default locale and URL root.
- Use document-level localization for page-builder pages when Sanity is added.
- Use field-level localized labels for small shared configuration metadata.
- Keep the configurator isolated as a smart component inside the Next.js app.
- Make the configurator page-builder compliant so Sanity editors can drop it into pages later.
- Keep product definitions portable:
  - Sanity can own the editorial/product metadata first.
  - The same product definition should be exportable as JSON later.
  - Pricing should stay replaceable by a real commerce service.
- Do not copy the `defgrp-3d-configurator` implementation directly; use it as interaction and camera inspiration only.
- Keep the first prototype limited to one straight-line kitchen with cabinet/front color options.

## Recommended Next Implementation Steps

1. Implement the remaining Project lifecycle workflows: Archive, Trash, restoring archived/trashed Projects, and the relevant UI.
2. Add locale route structure for `/`, `/en`, and `/es`.
3. Define the Sanity schema set:
   - site settings
   - page
   - localized slug
   - page-builder blocks
   - product definition
   - configurator block
4. Add a Sanity client layer and typed query boundary.
5. Replace `lib/content.ts` homepage content with Sanity-ready data shapes.
6. Add the configurator smart component as a page-builder block renderer.
7. Add a JSON schema or Zod schema for product definitions and URL configuration state.
8. Add basic Playwright flows:
   - homepage to configurator
   - color change updates URL
   - share URL restores state
   - checkout summary matches state
   - owner-only saved Project open, re-auth return, autosave/conflict recovery, local recovery-draft decisions, explicit version save/deduplication, paginated history, and safe version restore
9. Replace the box prototype with the first production-ready 3D asset pipeline.
